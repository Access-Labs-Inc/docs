## What's Access Protocol?

Access Protocol is a new model for content monetization that caters to all digital content creators.
It provides a monetization layer that creators can integrate into their site.
This integration allows them to establish paywalls and enable premium content for their supporters.
By using Access Protocol, creators can reinvent the way they monetize their content in the digital realm.
