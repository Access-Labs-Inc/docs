For more advanced integrations, it is possible to use our JavaScript bindings to interact with our Solana programs.

For creating and managing Access subscriptions we provide the `@accessprotocol/nft` npm package.
This alone should be sufficient for most functionality.

The core package `@accessprotocol/js` is for our legacy subscription model and should not be used for managing subscriptions.

For fetching information about subscriptions you can use our API.
