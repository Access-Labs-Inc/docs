<div className="md-description">How to integrate Access into your app</div>

There are multiple different ways you can integrate Access protocol into your application.

## Quick start

To quickly start integration you should use our already released language or framework integrations.

### Frontend integration
1. [Publisher](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/widget) ~ in form of Javascript widget activated by button provided for you
2. [Custom](/integration-guides/custom_integration/) ~ write your own Javascript with our [Javascript bindings](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/smart-contract/js)

### Fullstack integation
1. Use language idiomatic approach (backend):
- [Javascript](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/js)
- [Python](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/python)
- [Rust](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/rust)
- [Go](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/go)

2. Use framework approach (fullstack):
- Nuxt.js - https://github.com/TheBlockCrypto/bootstrap-ap-nuxt
- Next.js - https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/next-js-starter ([Demo](https://next-js-starter-vert.vercel.app/))
