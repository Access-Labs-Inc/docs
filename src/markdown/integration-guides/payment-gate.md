<div className="md-description">Integrating Access Protocol with payment gate</div>

The Access payment gate is the easiest way to integrate Access Protocol with your website.
It is similar to traditional payment portals familiar to web2 users and does not require
your website to support wallet connect.

The payment gate is available in the npm package `@accessprotocol/payment-gate` and the source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/payment-gate-sdk).
For a demo of payment gate integration, see the [payment gate demo GitHub repository](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/payment-gate-demo).
