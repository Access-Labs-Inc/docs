There's multiple different ways you can integrate Access protocol into your application.

## Quick start

To quickly start integration you should use our already released language or framework integrations.

### Frontend integration
1. [Publisher](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/widget) ~ in form of Javascript widget activated by button provided for you
2. Custom ~ write your own Javascript with our [Javascript bindings](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/smart-contract/js)

### Backend integation
1. Use language idiomatic approach:

- [Pythong](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/python)
- [Rust](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/rust)
- [Go](https://github.com/Access-Labs-Inc/access-protocol/tree/master/backends/go)

2. Use framework approach:
