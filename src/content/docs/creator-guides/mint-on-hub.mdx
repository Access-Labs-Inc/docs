**Order by:** the order in which your table is sorted. The parameters within this include locked, score and forever:  
 **Locked :** ordered by how much ACS have locked

    **Score:** ordered by the aggregate score of your ACS subscribers (score \= average amount of ACS locked \* duration spent in pool)

    **Forever:** ordered by amount locked in forever subscriptions

**Recipient limit:** The amount of subscribers that will receive your mint.

**Min Locked amount:** determines the minimum amount of ACS a subscriber needs to have locked in your pool to receive the drop

**Select random recipients:** selects a number of subscribers to randomly receive the mint

**Using AI to select your distribution**

You can use language to have AI determine the distribution you want. I.e. “mint 1 NFT to all of my subscribers”
