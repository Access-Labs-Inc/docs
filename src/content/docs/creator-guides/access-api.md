The Access API is our main API for partner and creator integrations.

In order to communiate with the API endpoints, you'll need an API key.

We currently share the API key with select partners and creators. Contact us if you are interested.

The Access API is documented with Swagger. Documentation is available at [papi.accessprotocol.co/swagger/](https://papi.accessprotocol.co/swagger/index.html).
