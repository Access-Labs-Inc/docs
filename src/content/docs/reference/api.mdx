## CSV exports

:::caution[3-step process]
This process can take a while to prepare the CSV file so we require you
to: 
1) Request the file and receive reference ID
2) Wait a few seconds (allow our backend prepare and upload the file to storage)
3) Pull the CSV file with reference ID

### Get emails of all supporters

#### Step 1: Request the file

Params: None

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="REST">
```sh
POST https://go-api.accessprotocol.co/file/emails
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="curl">

```sh
curl -X POST https://go-api.accessprotocol.co/file/emails \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACS_API_KEY"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

and you will get JSON with reference ID like so:

```
"5e491ab8-17f2-46ee-80d4-7eec9017f6be"
```

#### Step 2: Wait a few seconds ☕

How long? It all should be matter of 1-2s yet not guaranteed.
If you don't want to wait you can create a loop where you try to get
the file with Step 3 and if it fails (returns 404) you can re-try again with 1s delay. 

#### Step 3: Download the file

Params:
- `reference_id` you get it as output of Step 1 above


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="REST">

GET https://go-api.accessprotocol.co/file/link/{reference_id}

<TabItem label="curl">

```sh
curl https://go-api.accessprotocol.co/file/link/{reference_id} \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACS_API_KEY"

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
