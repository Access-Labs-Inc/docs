# Access Protocol documentation

React + TypeScript + Vite, project for Access Protocol documentation.

We use Scalar and their React library for the API documentation view.

Rest of the documentation is generated from markdown files.
See `src/markdown` and `guide.tsx` to configure the pages of the user guide.

`pnpm i` and `pnpm dev` to start building.
